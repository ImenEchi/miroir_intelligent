<h3>Title of the project:</h3>
miroirintelligent

<h3>Description:</h3>
A smart mirror that utilizes a weather sensor (such as the DHT11) and a face recognition system can be a useful and convenient tool for daily life. By using the weather sensor, the smart mirror can gather data about the current temperature and humidity, allowing it to provide accurate weather information to the user. The face recognition system can be used to personalize the weather recommendations, taking into account the user's specific preferences and needs. For example, if the weather is cold and rainy, the smart mirror might suggest a coat and umbrella for the user to wear. On a hot and sunny day, the smart mirror might recommend lighter clothing, such as a T-shirt and shorts. Overall, this type of smart mirror can help users stay prepared for the weather and make dressing for the day's conditions more convenient.

<h3>Objectif:</h3>
The main objective of a smart mirror project that incorporates weather sensing and face recognition technology is to create a convenient and personalized tool for daily use. The weather sensor allows the smart mirror to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information, while the face recognition system enables the mirror to personalize the recommendations it gives based on the user's preferences and needs. This can help users stay informed about the weather and make dressing for the day's conditions more convenient. Additionally, a smart mirror that incorporates these features may also have other objectives, such as enhancing the user's daily routine, providing a unique and innovative user experience, or exploring the capabilities of emerging technologies.
